#CHANGELOG

##Preface
These are changes that I have made to the xsb system as part of my work on indexing and B+ Trees.

##DI (Just In Time Indexing)
Although this project is not completed, there is the implementation of a potentially useful instruction to catch the fallthrough of a SOB indexing instruction.

Essentially, this can tell you where to place an index if you do not already have one in dynamically asserted code.

###Installing

To Install, perform the following modifications (line numbers according to most recent XSB build, unmodified ( [3.3.6, found here](http://xsb.sourceforge.net/downloads/XSB336.tar.gz)) )

... todo ....

##B+ Tree Library

Still a major work in progress, using this file to keep track of changes to XSB system files as i make them.

1. __emu/io_builtins_xsb.c__ \[Line 836\]

Change:

`} else return (Cell)NULL;`

To:

	} else if(code == 3) {/** B+ Trees **/

  	}
  	else return (Cell)NULL;
